# SnaProxy

A simple shell script for quickly setting up or removing a system-wide HTTP/HTTPS proxy in Raspberry Pi OS.

> **Note:** This tool may work on other Linux distributions but has only been tested on Raspberry Pi OS. It also currently relies on a bash installation which may or may not come with your distro.

## Usage

Just run the script.

```bash
./SnaProxy.sh
```

You will be prompted to either set a proxy if one doesn't exist or remove one that's already set. You will be promted to reboot afterward.

If there are any issues I didn't catch with this script, please post a GitHub Issue.
